implement sensebert with semi-supervised learning self-training approach and knowledge base(i.e., babelnet) and create a model that understands word sense.
```





















Self-training is a popular technique in semi-supervised learning  used to improve a model's performance by leveraging a large amount of unlabeled data along with a smaller set of labeled data. Here's a breakdown of the process for your WSD project using SenseBERT:

**1. Prepare your Data:**

* You'll need two sets of data:
    * **Labeled Data:** This is a relatively small dataset where each word instance has its correct sense manually labeled. This is crucial for guiding the initial training of SenseBERT.
    * **Unlabeled Data:** This is a much larger dataset where the word senses are unknown. This data provides the fuel for self-training.

**2. Initial Training:**

* Train your SenseBERT model on the labeled data. During this training, SenseBERT learns to map words and their contexts to their corresponding sense representations.

**3. Leverage the Unlabeled Data:**

* Use the trained SenseBERT model to predict senses for all the words in the unlabeled data. 
* Since this data is unlabeled, SenseBERT will assign a probability score to each possible sense for each word.

**4. Selecting High-Confidence Predictions:**

* Not all predictions from the unlabeled data will be equally reliable. You'll need to identify the most confident predictions for use in the next step.
* This typically involves setting a threshold for the probability score. For example, you might only consider predictions where SenseBERT assigns a probability of 90% or higher to a particular sense.

**5. Creating Pseudo-Labels:**

* Take the high-confidence predictions from step 4 and assign them as pseudo-labels to the corresponding words in the unlabeled data. These pseudo-labels essentially act like "newly acquired" labeled data points.

**6. Retraining with More Data:**

* Now you have a combined dataset containing the original labeled data and the newly created pseudo-labeled data from the unlabeled set.
* Retrain SenseBERT using this expanded dataset. During this retraining, the model learns not only from the original labeled data but also from the (hopefully) accurate pseudo-labels, potentially improving its ability to disambiguate words.

**7. Iteration and Improvement:**

* The beauty of self-training is its iterative nature. You can repeat steps 3-6 several times.
* With each iteration, the model is exposed to more "labeled" data (thanks to the pseudo-labels) and has the opportunity to refine its understanding of word senses. This can lead to gradual improvement in its WSD performance on unseen data.

**Here are some additional points to consider:**

* **Quality of Pseudo-Labels:**  The success of self-training hinges on the quality of the pseudo-labels.  Incorrectly assigned pseudo-labels can mislead the model and hinder its performance. Setting a high confidence threshold and carefully selecting unlabeled data can help mitigate this risk. 
* **Active Learning:**  A variant of self-training called active learning can be used to strategically choose the most informative unlabeled data for labeling. This can be particularly efficient if manual labeling is a bottleneck.

By effectively implementing self-training, you can leverage the power of unlabeled data to enhance SenseBERT's capabilities for word sense disambiguation in your project.
